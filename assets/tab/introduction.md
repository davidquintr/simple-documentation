# Introduction

> This was made originally for [EXPEDOC](https://davidquintr.github.io/portfolio/blog/expedoc-development) for the confiscated 'Universidad Centroamericana', this is not the case but is a media for let know about the run over of the freedom of expression in Nicaragua. For you, government empleyee, you can change the name to everything you want, but you can't erase the legacy of 63 years, In All Things to Love and Serve, #SomosUCA.

The mission of this, is simplify the mission of get documentation from a project, this is equiped with [Markdown](./) for a better syntaxis of code, also a code interpretation with Prism.js library, natively supports C, C#, C++ syntaxis.

For the visual style, I've use [TailwindCSS](./), is not a recommended version to production, but it works for this simple task.
